What it jitpy?
==============

jitpy is a hack to embed your PyPy inside your CPython, so you can
call pypy-optimized functions from cpython using limited interface,
provided the types you pass are either simple immutable types or numpy
arrays. It's similar in the use patters to `numba`_, however it does
have very different characteristics. A simple example::

  from jitpy import setup
  setup('<path-to-pypy-home>')
  from jitpy.wrapper import jittify

  @jittify([int, float], float)
  def func(count, no):
      s = 0
      for i in range(count):
         s += no
      return s

  func(100000, 1.2)

This function will perform computations in the underlaying PyPy, thus yielding
a significant speed benefit (around 50x in my case)

Installing
==========

jitpy requires a new PyPy (newer than 28th of Nov), which can be e.g.
downloaded from PyPy `nightlies`_. Otherwise it can be installed via
``pip install jitpy``.

Using
